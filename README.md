# Filter-code
This code splits an image by grayscale value and assigns colors to groups of values 

# Start with an input image like this:
![First Image](Images/img.jpeg)

# The program then converts the image into a grayscale vector:
![Grayscale](Images/grayscale.png)

# Next the grayscale image is broken into 6 sub-images based on an adjustable filter:
![Grayscale2](Images/grayscale2.png)

# Finally, each subimage gets mapped to a new color:
![Final Img](Images/final_img.png)
