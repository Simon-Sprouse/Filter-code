# Copmuter Vision Filtering Art
This progam uses the OpenCV library computer vision tools to generate Pop Art! 

# First, the user is prompted to enter an image:
For purpose of demonstration, this readme will work with this image of the manhatten skyline. Credit: 
![First Image](Images/img9.jpeg)

# The program then converts the image into a grayscale vector:
![Grayscale](Images/grayscale.png)

# Next the grayscale image is broken into 6 sub-images based on an adjustable filter:
![Grayscale2](Images/grayscale2.png)

# Finally, each subimage gets mapped to a new color:
![Final Img](Images/final_img.png)
